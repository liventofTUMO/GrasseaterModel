A model of life in the lower sections of the Earth's ecosystem. 

Here there are five beings:

	Green represents Grass
	Yellow represents the Grasseater which eats Grass
	Red represents the Meateater which eats Grasseaters
	Brown represents the Mushrooms which respawns Grass when there is no more grass but can only eaten by Everythingeaters

All of this spawns randomly
